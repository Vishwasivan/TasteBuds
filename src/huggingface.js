**Recipe Name: Creamy Chicken and Corn Pasta**

**Ingredients**:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried oregano (to taste)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup corn kernels (frozen or canned)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 lb pasta (choose your favorite shape)
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
- Fresh parsley (optional)

**Instructions**:

1. **Prepare the Chicken**:
   - Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried oregano.
   - Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken for 5-7 minutes on each side, until the internal temperature reaches **165°F (74°C)**.
   - Transfer the chicken to a plate and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into thin strips.

2. **Cook the Pasta**:
   - Cook the pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted, boiling water.
   - Drain the pasta, reserving about 1 cup of pasta water, and set aside.

3. **Prepare the Corn**:
   - In the same skillet you used to cook the chicken, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.
   - Sauté the corn kernels over medium heat until they turn golden brown and tender (about 3-4 minutes).

4. **Make the Sauce**:
   - Pour the heavy cream into the skillet with the corn and bring it to a gentle simmer.
   - Stir occasionally for 4-5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and coat the corn.
   - Season with additional salt, pepper, and spices to taste.

5. **Combine**:
   - Add the cooked pasta and sliced chicken to the skillet, stirring gently to combine everything with the creamy corn sauce.
   - If needed, add some reserved pasta water to achieve your desired sauce consistency.

6. **Serve**:
   - Divide the pasta among individual plates.
   - Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley, if desired.
   - Enjoy your delicious meal!!
