## üñ•Ô∏è Installation (For Developers)
If you want to run the project locally:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vishwasivan/TasteBuds.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd TasteBuds

# Install dependencies 
npm install  # or yarn install

# Start the development server
npm start  # or yarn start 
# or
npm run dev  
```

# Import and use the API key in your project
In your JavaScript file (src/huggingface.js), import the API key and initialize the Hugging Face inference:
```javascript
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY;
const hf = new HfInference(apiKey);

export async function getRecipeFromMistral(ingredientsArr) {
    const ingredientsString = ingredientsArr.join(", ");
    try {
        const response = await hf.chatCompletion({
            model: import.meta.env.VITE_MODEL_NAME,
            messages: [
                { role: "system", content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
                { role: "user", content: `I have ${ingredientsString}. Please give me a recipe you'd recommend I make!` },
            ],
            max_tokens: 1024,
        });
        return response.choices[0].message.content;
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
    }
}
```
This ensures your API key and model name are securely accessed from the `.env` file.  

# Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
```
VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-huggingface-api-key
VITE_MODEL_NAME=mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1
```
Make sure to replace `your-huggingface-api-key` with your actual Hugging Face API key. The model name is already set to `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`.

### Using Other API Keys
Along with the Hugging Face API, you can also use API keys from other services. To do this, add additional environment variables in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_OTHER_API_KEY=your-other-api-key
```
Then, access it in your code similarly:
```javascript
const otherApiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_OTHER_API_KEY;
```
This allows flexibility in integrating multiple APIs as needed.
